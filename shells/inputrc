# Readline Init File: `~/.inputrc`

# If set to 'on', Readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive fashion.
# The default value is 'off'.
set completion-ignore-case on

# If set to ‘on’, and completion-ignore-case is enabled,
# Readline treats hyphens (‘-’) and underscores (‘_’) as equivalent when performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
set completion-map-case on

# This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.
# If set to ‘on’, words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
# The default value is ‘off’.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# If set to ‘on’, a character denoting a file’s type is appended to the filename when listing possible completions.
# The default is ‘off’.
